📘 Intro to Routing and Switching – Course Project
Welcome to my project repository for the Intro to Routing and Switching (CIS202) course at ECPI University, part of my Professional and Technical Skills program.

This repository documents my work over a 5-week period, showcasing performance assessments and hands-on configurations that demonstrate my understanding of routing and switching concepts. The project aligns with the course’s learning outcomes and is designed to reflect my growth in configuring and troubleshooting medium-sized networks.

🧭 Project Overview
This project focuses on applying intermediate networking skills using routers and switches in simulated environments. Each week includes a performance assessment with step-by-step instructions, configurations, and reflections.

Topics covered include:
InterVLAN routing
Dynamic routing protocols
Network Address Translation (NAT)
Basic router and switch security
Standard access control lists (ACLs)

The work presented here supports the following program outcomes:
Use of professional tools and technologies
Effective technical communication
Network configuration and administration
Network security implementation and troubleshooting

📂 What You'll Find Here
Step-by-step performance assessments
Configuration examples and diagrams
Troubleshooting tips and best practices

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Cisco Packet Tracer or GNS3
Command Line Interface (CLI)

📌 Who This Is For
This course is ideal for:
Students new to networking
Aspiring network administrators
Anyone preparing for entry-level networking certifications (e.g., CompTIA Network+, Cisco CCNA)
