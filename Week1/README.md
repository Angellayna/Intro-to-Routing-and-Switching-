📘 Week 1 – Networking Foundations & Multi-Router Configuration

🗓️ Overview
In Week 1 of my Intro to Routing and Switching project, I focused on foundational networking concepts and applied them by configuring a small, subnetted network using multiple routers and various network devices in Cisco Packet Tracer.

This week’s work builds on the Guided Practices and introduces more independent configuration tasks, including router setup, VLANs, DHCP, and static routing.

🎯 Objectives
Understand and apply subnetting in a multi-router environment
Configure router interfaces and serial links
Set up VLANs and trunking on switches
Implement DHCP on routers
Configure static routes and test end-to-end connectivity

🛠️ Tools Used
Cisco Packet Tracer
Cisco 4331 Routers
Cisco 3560 Switches
PCs, Server, Wireless Router, Smartphone
