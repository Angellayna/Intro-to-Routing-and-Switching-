# Week 2 â€“ Performance Assessment: VLSM

This assessment demonstrates my ability to configure a subnetted network using Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) and various network devices in Cisco Packet Tracer. It builds on the skills developed in the Guided Practices and applies them in a more independent, hands-on scenario.

## Task 1 â€“ Device Setup and Labeling
- Add and label the following devices:
  - 3 Ã— Cisco 4331 routers
  - 3 Ã— 3560 switches
  - 4 Ã— PCs
  - 1 Ã— Server
  - 1 Ã— WRT300N wireless router
  - 1 Ã— Smartphone
- Label each device with your student ID and device type.
- Take a screenshot of the labeled devices.

ðŸ“¸ **Deliverable:** Screenshot of labeled devices.

## Task 2 â€“ VLSM Configuration
- Configure router interfaces with IP addresses and subnet masks using VLSM.
- Set clock rates on DCE ends of serial links.
- Configure VLANs and trunks on switches.
- Verify IP address assignment on PCs, server, and wireless router.

ðŸ“¸ **Deliverables:**
- `show ip interface brief` on routers
- Clock rate configuration on each router
- `show running-config` on switches (VLANs and trunks)
- DHCP IP address verification on all end devices

## Task 3 â€“ RIPv2 Routing
- Configure RIPv2 routing protocol on routers.
- Verify routing tables and test connectivity between devices.

ðŸ“¸ **Deliverables:**
- `show ip route` on routers
- Ping results between devices

## Task 4 â€“ DHCP Setup
- Configure DHCP pools on routers.
- Verify IP address assignment on PCs, server, and wireless router.

ðŸ“¸ **Deliverables:**
- DHCP IP address verification on all end devices

## Task 5 â€“ SSH and Telnet Configuration
- Configure SSH and Telnet access on routers.
- Verify remote access to routers.

ðŸ“¸ **Deliverables:**
- `show running-config` on routers (SSH and Telnet configuration)
- Verification of remote access

## Task 6 â€“ DNS Testing
- Configure DNS settings on PCs and server.
- Verify DNS resolution and connectivity.

ðŸ“¸ **Deliverables:**
- DNS resolution verification on PCs and server

## Conclusion
- Recap of key points
- The impact of VLSM on network efficiency
- Final thoughts and open discussion
