📘 Week 2 – InterVLAN Routing & Dynamic Routing Protocols

🗓️ Overview
In Week 2 of my Intro to Routing and Switching project, I expanded on the foundational skills from Week 1 by implementing InterVLAN routing and configuring dynamic routing protocols. This week’s focus was on enabling communication between VLANs and automating route discovery across multiple routers.

🎯 Objectives
Configure and verify InterVLAN routing on a router-on-a-stick setup
Create and assign VLANs on managed switches
Configure trunk ports and subinterfaces
Implement and test dynamic routing protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF, or EIGRP)
Verify routing tables and end-to-end connectivity

🛠️ Tools Used
Cisco Packet Tracer
Cisco 4331 Routers
Cisco 3560 Switches
PCs and Servers
