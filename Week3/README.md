📘 Week 3 – Access Control Lists, NAT & Basic Network Security

🗓️ Overview
In Week 3 of my Intro to Routing and Switching project, I focused on securing and managing traffic within a network using Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Network Address Translation (NAT). This week also introduced basic router and switch security configurations to help protect network infrastructure.

🎯 Objectives
Create and apply standard and extended ACLs
Control traffic flow between VLANs and subnets
Configure static and dynamic NAT
Implement basic router and switch security (e.g., passwords, banners, SSH)
Test and verify ACL and NAT functionality

🛠️ Tools Used
Cisco Packet Tracer
Cisco 4331 Routers
Cisco 3560 Switches
PCs and Servers
