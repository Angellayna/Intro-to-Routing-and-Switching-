📘 Week 5 – Final Integration & Network Validation

🗓️ Overview
In Week 5 of my Intro to Routing and Switching project, I completed a comprehensive network integration that brought together all the skills developed throughout the course. This included configuring routing protocols, VLANs, ACLs, NAT, DHCP, and implementing security best practices. The final focus was on validating the network through testing and troubleshooting.

🎯 Objectives
Integrate routing, switching, and security configurations into a unified network
Validate end-to-end connectivity across VLANs and subnets
Apply ACLs and NAT to control and manage traffic
Use diagnostic tools to troubleshoot and resolve issues
Document and verify the final network setup

🛠️ Tools Used
Cisco Packet Tracer
Cisco CLI tools (show, ping, traceroute, debug)
Network simulation and testing utilities
